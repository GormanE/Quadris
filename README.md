# Quadris

This is the repository for my game "Quadris", a Tetris-like game written in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and deployed on the Google Play Store. Definitely not Tetris. I had originally deployed this app back in 2016 using a service called [PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/), as can be seen in the [phonegap branch on this repo](https://github.com/edgorman/Quadris/tree/phonegap). The switch to Godot was a chance to teach myself Godot and create a more up to date version of the app.

## Installation

```
cd your/repo/directory
